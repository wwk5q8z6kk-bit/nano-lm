## COMPUTE_POSTURE

```text
training_backend = KAGGLE_AND_RUNPOD
training_status = ACTIVE

backend_policy =
KAGGLE_FREE_WHEN_RUNTIME_FITS;
RUNPOD_FOR_EXACT_GPU_RUNTIME_PERSISTENCE_OR_MANAGED_INFERENCE

routine_runpod_training =
ALLOWED_WITHIN_ACTIVE_EXPERIMENT_BUDGET

materially_costly_run =
EXPERIMENT_SCOPED_AUTHORIZATION

confirmatory_evidential_run =
PREREG_PLUS_EXPERIMENT_SCOPED_AUTHORIZATION

phi_or_private_data =
NOT_AUTHORIZED

Local Apple Silicon / CPU remains available for cheap mechanism experiments,
development, preprocessing, evaluation, and other zero-cost exploratory work.
```

Choose the cheapest backend that satisfies the experiment. Kaggle is preferred
when its free runtime fits. RunPod is used for exact GPU/runtime requirements,
persistent volumes, or managed inference. A new materially costly run still
needs experiment-scoped authorization. A confirmatory evidential run needs
preregistration plus experiment-scoped authorization.

## Current empirical boundary

H6 is complete and **REJECTED**. The one-shot known-development evaluation was
consumed on Kaggle and is recorded in
[`artifacts/nano_h6/H6_TERMINAL_DECISION.json`](../artifacts/nano_h6/H6_TERMINAL_DECISION.json).
The selected checkpoint passed overall, held-value, missing-target, failure,
and state-balance gates, but failed absence, conflict, and uncertainty gates.
The exact H6 coupling must not be rerun or silently renamed. The next task is
row-level diagnosis of abstention calibration before proposing another learned
architecture.

## Current gate sequence

## Training / compute policy

| Class | Policy |
|-------|--------|
| Training backends | **Kaggle + RunPod** selected by runtime fit and cost |
| Training status | **ACTIVE** |
| Local Apple Silicon / CPU | **ALLOWED** — development, smoke, analysis, preprocessing, evaluation, small/cheap experiments |
| Routine RunPod training | **ALLOWED_WITHIN_ACTIVE_EXPERIMENT_BUDGET** |
| Materially costly run | **EXPERIMENT_SCOPED_AUTHORIZATION** |
| Confirmatory / evidential run | **PREREG + EXPERIMENT_SCOPED_AUTHORIZATION** |
| PHI / private owner material | **NOT_AUTHORIZED** |

Do not treat RunPod as the only backend, and do not treat every paid GPU job as automatically owner-gated.

## Owner gates (standing)

Materially costly runs outside the active experiment budget, confirmatory evidential runs without required prereg, PHI/private clinical data, protected tag moves, clinical claims.
